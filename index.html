  <h1 id="name">Hello. My name is Elaina Smith</h1>
  <p>
  <p>This is my first attempt at producing a website as I train to become a Web Developer / Software Engineer at Fullstack Academy.</p>
  
  <h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Before coming to Fullstack Academy I owned and operating a travel agency specializing in all-inclusive luxury vacations and cruise vacations. Prior to that, I was a international Flight Attendent which gave me the opportunity to visit many different countries and cities around the world.</p>

<p>I have always had a deep interest in technology so much so that I have built pc's from bare bones. I've been an avid and professional (video) gamer for many years and as the tecnology has evolved in the gaming industry I want to become apart of this evolution by becoming a software engineer in Virtual Reality and help develop new systems within this facinating technolgy.</p>
